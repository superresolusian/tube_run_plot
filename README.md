Hello! Here is a (hopefully) handy guide to downloading Strava data and using it to create a map of all of the London Underground stations that you have run to.

# Getting data from Strava
I manually downloaded all of my run files from Strava about four months after completing the runs. This was very boring so I recommend doing it as you go along!
You need to download your run files from Strava on a computer (not mobile) - you'll need to go to each activity, press the three dots on the left, and then press Export original. This should download a file with extension .fit

You should organise them by tube line (i.e. which colour you want that run plotted as - obviously loads of stations are more than one line, so just pick one). My folder structure looks like this:

I also put them all into an 'all' folder as well for versatility when I was messing around with plotting.
